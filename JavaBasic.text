Java Basic Class & Objects :

    Object Oriented Programming: 

        Objects ---> real world entities- car, bike, laptop, etc.
                    properties : brand, speed -> attributes/field
                    behavious : start() -> function

        Class : a class is a blueprint or template for creating objects, defining the data (attributes) 
                and behavior (methods) that objects of that class will have.
