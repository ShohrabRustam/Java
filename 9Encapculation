Encapsulation: Hinding the internal details of objects and exposing only when necessary.

    Package: 
            Package are like folders in a file System that help organize the code.
            They group related classes and inteface to Improved code Modularity & reusability.

    Type of Packages: 
        Build in packages: Java Predefine packages (like java.util,java.io etc)

        User-Define packages: Custom packages created by developers.


    Access Modifier: 
                    public : access everywhere.
                    protected: access inside same packages or sub class. 
                    default : access only inside the package.
                    private : access only within the class.

    Encapsulation : encapsulation is a core object-oriented programming principle that bundles data (variables) and the methods (functions) that operate on that data into a single unit, known as a class, while restricting direct access to some of an object's components.Â
