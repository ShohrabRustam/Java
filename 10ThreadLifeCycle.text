whenever we will create a thread the state of the thread will be new.

After create new thread it will be runnable state.

ex = Thread t = new Thread(); // state will be new
        t.start(); // state will be RUNNABLE 
        to get the state use (t.getState());

RUNNABLE: 
            1.Ready to run 
            2.Running

Not RUNNABLE:
                TimeWaiting
                Waiting
                Blocked
