Execute Engine :
        it execute butes code.
    
    Classified Into 3 Parts:
            
            1. Interpreter
            
            2. Just in time Compiler (JIT)
            
            3. Garbage Collector

Interpreter : Interprets byte code line by line and execute.

Disadvantage: if a method call multiple times, Interpretation multiple times.


Just in time Compiler: 
            Increase efficiency of Interpreter
            JIT provides direct native code to avoid re-interpretation

Garbage Collector:
                    Destroys Un-Referenced Object.


JAVA Native Interface : 
                        Interface interact with native method Libraries.


Native Method Libraries:
                    Collection of the Native Libraries (C, C++) which are required by Execution Engine.
